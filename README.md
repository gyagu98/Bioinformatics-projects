# DNA Sequence GC Content Analysis

This project compares the GC content of multiple DNA sequences using a 
Python script. These DNA sequences are embedded within the python script.

## How to Run

To compare the GC content between different sequences, edit the python 
script to include your DNA sequences of interest and then run: 

python3 dna_analysis_2.py

## An example output 

Sequence 1: ATGCGCGTATCGGCTAGCTAGCTAGGCTAA
GC Content: 53.33%
------------------------------
Sequence 2: GCGTATCGCGGCTAGCATCGGCTATCGGGC
GC Content: 66.67%
------------------------------
Sequence 3: ATATATATATATATATATATATATATATAT
GC Content: 0.00%
------------------------------
